# Getting Started with the HSRobot Kit

The HSRobot kit comes with everything needed to have fun, but needs a bit of elbow greese to get going.

The Raspberry Pi powering HSRobot has been configured to automatically setup a wireless Hotspot. 


Once the Raspberry Pi is powered on, the HSRobot kit is ready to go! A software named `VNC Server` is already installed and configured to run on the Raspberry Pi. You will need to install the [`VNC Viewer`](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/combined/?lai_vid=qqx2bKKyXFJLv&lai_sr=10-14&lai_sl=l) software on your computer to be able to access HSRobot.
