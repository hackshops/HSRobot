# Getting Started with the HSRobot Kit

The HSRobot kit comes with everything needed to have fun, but needs a bit of elbow greese to get going.

The Raspberry Pi powering HSRobot is powered by the latest version of Pi OS and has been configured to automatically connect to a known wireless network. 

When the Raspberry Pi is powered on, it will automatically connect to a wireless network named `HackShops` and assumes the password is `H@chSh0ps`. Raspberry Pi is also able to connect directly to a wired network via a network cable. If you have access to a wired network, that might be the easiest way to get started. Plug in a network cable to the network port on the Raspberry Pi and power it on. 

Once the Raspberry Pi is powered on, the HSRobot kit is ready to go! A software named `VNC Server` is already installed and configured to run on the Raspberry Pi. You will need to install the [`VNC Viewer`](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/combined/?lai_vid=qqx2bKKyXFJLv&lai_sr=10-14&lai_sl=l) software on your computer to be able to access HSRobot.
